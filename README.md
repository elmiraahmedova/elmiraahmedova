- 👋 Hi, I’m @elmiraahmedova
- 👀 I’m interested in all things data, its quality, value and insights, specifically in life sciences.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Scala (coursera from Martin Odersky) and mastering Python (brushing up the basics with Zed Shaw's Hard Way book).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bioinformatics projects. I can add value with domain knowledge in Molecular biology and will pick up the coding bit quickly.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
